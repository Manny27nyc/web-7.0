&lt;p&gt;As you are aware, over the last few weeks, we’ve been seeing an increasing amount of spam from other networks intending to mislead and influence long term running projects, namespaces and channels into moving to another new network which was formed parallel to freenode. While group contacts from the channels did not contact freenode staff directly, we were rather surprised when we received reports of unpleasant elements operating in the background and influencing these projects, namespaces and channels with false information in order to harm freenode’s administration and staff members’ images and paint a false narrative altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conjunction with yesterday’s events, in retrospect, we should have handled the action of closing down channels slightly differently. Originally, we posted a draft policy revision and solicited feedback in #freenode-policy-feedback.  After several days, we discussed various feedback internally that was given.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">rasengan</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode exists for FOSS</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/for-foss</link><description>&lt;p&gt;To the FOSS Community,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Current global users: 68347&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current global user count of freenode exceeds the user count of the &lt;a href="https://netsplit.de/networks/top10.php"&gt;2nd-6th&lt;/a&gt; largest networks, combined.  I am pleased to announce, the plan to destroy freenode has failed!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">rasengan</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>On freenode and its commitment to FOSS</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-is-foss</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear freenode,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I want to thank the hard working staff for keeping freenode running during these challenging times.  Without you, this wouldn't be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">rasengan</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Changes to realnames of matrix.org bridged users</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/matrix-bridge-realname</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://matrix.org/"&gt;matrix.org&lt;/a&gt; runs a bridge (matrix-appservice-irc) from
their Matrix homeserver to freenode that allow Matrix users from any
homeserver that federates with matrix.org to join channels on freenode and
intermingle with the normal IRC userbase. These users have their Matrix User
Id (username and homeserver, e.g. &lt;code&gt;@jess:freenode.net&lt;/code&gt;) put in the realname
field of their IRC connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the need to differentiate users by which homeserver they are using
has arisen for multiple reasons, and we've worked with the matrix.org bridge
operators to better format Matrix User Ids to suit the limited space provided
by IRC realnames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realnames pose a slight problem for this usage; the maximum length for a
Matrix User Id is 255 characters, whereas the maximum length for an IRC
realname is 50 characters and things longer than that get truncated, which
means if people have a Matrix username of 50 characters, it will truncate off
the entirety of their homeserver.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jess</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Changes to ChanServ regarding cloaks</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/chanserv-cloak-changes</link><description>&lt;p&gt;freenode offers &lt;a href="/kb/answer/cloaks"&gt;cloaks&lt;/a&gt; to our users, which replace one's
hostname or IP address in various places with a project affiliation or lack
thereof. Many of you will be aware that cloaks on freenode &lt;a href="/kb/answer/cloaks#cloaks-do-not-effectively-hide-your-ip"&gt;are not offered as a
security measure&lt;/a&gt; and
that various means are available to third parties to see through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many users acquire cloaks for security/privacy reasons anyway, and
we've taken the decision to close some of the more glaring holes in the
protection they offer. Please do note that cloaks are still not recommended
for hiding a user's IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have deployed the following changes to ChanServ:&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[Scheduled Maintenance] Services database spring cleaning</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/scheduled-maintenance-services-database-spring-cleaning</link><description>&lt;p&gt;During the Easter weekend (April 12th to 15th) we will be purging the freenode services database. 
We periodically prune the database to remove expired accounts, nicknames and channels. Just like previous database purges we will be removing any accounts and nicknames that have not been used for 120 days at the time of the purge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate that not everyone remembers to identify to services, and we would urge you to check and, if necessary, ensure that you identify so as to not lose your account/nickname(s) during the purge if you use any that may be approaching the expiration limit (120 days) used in connection with the services purge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that nicknames and accounts expire separately and you will need to identify to all grouped nicks that you wish to keep, and don’t forget to also check any second accounts you may have for bots or similar (for the sake of your fellow community members we would recommend cycling through any nicknames with a client that is not joined to channels so as to minimise disruption).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fuchs</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2020 10:42:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Private Internet Access and the freenode project</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-pia-changes</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week we learned the news of the proposed merger between Private Internet Access (LTMI) and Kape Technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode is not affected by this merger. Kape has indicated that it will honour Private Internet Access' server sponsorship for the next six months as a minimum, and we hope that the company will continue to support the project also after this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the freenode project is fortunate to be in a position where it does not rely on a single sponsor and we have a broad and diverse range of supporters; and the freenode project will continue being part of and having access to support from the Imperial Family Companies (formerly London Trust Media Holdings (LTMH)). &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Matrix GDPR access request data overshare</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/matrix-overshare</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may already be aware that in the process of servicing a request for personal
information under the GDPR, &lt;a href="https://matrix.org"&gt;Matrix.org&lt;/a&gt; provided a user with a data
dump that mistakenly included events that user had not been a party to. We
suggest reading Matrix.org's &lt;a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/07/24/data-portability-tooling-bug"&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of 2019-08-04 UTC we were notified by the recipient of the dump
that the errant data included messages from freenode users and, in a spirit of
transparency, felt it was important to keep you informed of any potential
security issue concerning you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2019 18:52:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Moving webchat to Kiwi IRC</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/moving-to-kiwiirc</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after years of providing our good old &lt;a href="https://qwebirc.org/"&gt;qwebirc&lt;/a&gt; based webchat,
we are excited to announce that freenode is moving to a new &lt;a href="https://kiwiirc.com/"&gt;Kiwi IRC&lt;/a&gt;
based solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change will occur during this weekend (June 22nd / 23rd).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fuchs, ilbelkyr</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2019 20:42:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ircd-seven 1.1.8</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/seven-118</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're preparing to release version 1.1.8 of ircd-seven and deploy it to the
production network over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release incorporates a number of user-facing changes:&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 10:15:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode Next Gen Tor Hidden Service</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/torv3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, the Tor Project has developed a &lt;a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/NextGenOnions"&gt;new Tor Hidden
Services protocol&lt;/a&gt;.
It has a few improvements over the previous version, including better
cryptography using SHA3 and ed25519.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added a new Tor Hidden Service address to &lt;a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat#accessing-freenode-via-tor"&gt;our instructions for connecting
to freenode via Tor&lt;/a&gt;
that uses the new protocol.

What an incredible weekend. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to all those who joined us for freenode #live this weekend. Whether you participated in person or tuned into the livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were fortunate enough to have an exceptionally inspiring and engaging speaker line-up - thank you so much for coming to inspire the community. Thank you also to our supportive sponsors who have enabled us to put this event on again, and of course the freenode volunteer team - both those who detached for a weekend to throw themselves into an entirely different type of volunteering and those who stayed behind to keep the network running and also doubled as livestream monitors, a special thank you to you all for your willingness to adapt and get stuck in. A huge thank you also to the venue staff, and to the AV technicians! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU are freenode.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Nov 2018 22:59:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Did you hear? freenode #live is coming to town!</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/live</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A little over a month from now, the second freenode #live will take place at We The Curious in Bristol. With talks from many free and open source community leaders such as Leslie Hawthorn, VM Brasseur, Chris Lamb and Bradley Kuhn, freenode #live once again brings an international free software gathering to the South West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other exhibitors at this year’s event will be the returning main sponsor, &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/freend/"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Free Software Foundation, OpenSuSE, Minetest, Linux Journal and the Handshake Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; is a new decentralized alternative DNS root, and for a short time before launch freenode users and members of the free and open source community are encouraged to sign up today at Handshake.org and receive free Handshake coins that can be used to purchase domain names when Handshake launches in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">mattl from Handshake</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 16:47:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spam filtering</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spamfilter</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you are aware, we've been experiencing significant spam over the
past few weeks. As a result, we have decided to roll out a server-side spam
filter. Unlike our current spam-mitigating techniques, this system applies to
private messages and does not let the first matching line get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various ethical concerns have been raised over the course of introducing this
feature. They'll be addressed below. The short version, though, is that the
system has various limitations built in designed to prevent operator abuse.
Only a tiny bit of information can get out of the filters, and they do not have
access to much information themselves, to the extent that we believe the
obvious ways to abuse such a feature are impractical.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:47:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Continued and persistent spambot attack and clarification</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As you may be aware there has been a prolonged spambot attack directed at freenode (and other IRC networks) in recent weeks, targeting a number of individuals involved with freenode and the wider IRC communities. The freenode team, and people involved with the wider IRC communities, are working hard to mitigate and reduce the spam that hits your community channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam content has changed in the last few days and while I am extremely glad that the attacks appear to no longer focus on members of the volunteer team and no longer involve libellous and false statements relating to these volunteers, we feel we should provide some clarification on some of the claims that are being made in the current spamwave relating to freenode and its involvement in Handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current spambot attacks state that freenode is involved with an 'ICO scam' relating to the &lt;a href="https://handshake.org"&gt;Handshake&lt;/a&gt; project. Most freenode volunteers have involvement with one or several FOSS projects, often projects that use the freenode network as part of their communications toolbox. Handshake is no different in this regard, as it is a project that I have been involved with. I am deeply sorry to those affected by the spam, to freenode and to Handshake that spammers have chosen to use my involvement as a further platform to attack the freenode communities, and now also Handshake. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 06:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
